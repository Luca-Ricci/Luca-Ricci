- 👋 Hi, I’m @Luca-Ricci
- 👀 I’m interested in robotics, coding and electronics. Sometimes I put a white or a grey hat on my head, the color depends a lot on my mood
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to develop android apps that interface with your phone's USB-C port
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on pretty much anything, the more I can learn from others the better!
